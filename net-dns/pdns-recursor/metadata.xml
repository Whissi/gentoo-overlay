		With a small codebase, the PowerDNS Recursor is an advanced recursor currently
		serving the DNS resolving needs of over 2 million Internet connections. Besides
		high performance (using kqueue or epoll, over 15 thousand qps on commodity
		hardware), it provides advanced anti-spoofing measures. In addition, the program
		caches server performance and timeouts, making it both network and user friendly.
		It also has built-in hooks for making graphs with rrdtool, providing insight into
		nameserver performance.
